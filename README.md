# MBQC

In this repository, we implement a **compiler for Pauli measurement–based quantum computation** (MBQC).

Given an input **Clifford circuit**, our compiler produces an equivalent program in a **Pauli measurement language**. The long-term goal of this project is to connect high-level circuit descriptions to a measurement-only execution model, together with machine-checked correctness proofs.

This repository is intended both as:
- a **research artifact** accompanying the paper, and  
- a **learning platform** for students and practitioners who want to understand Pauli measurement–based quantum computation and its compilation pipeline.

---

## Goals

- Support a **Clifford circuit input language** (e.g., generated by standard quantum circuit toolchains).
- Compile these circuits into a **Pauli measurement program** that uses only:
  - state preparations in simple basis states, and  
  - sequences of single-qubit Pauli measurements (plus classical control / corrections).
- Provide a clear separation between:
  - the **source semantics** of Clifford circuits, and  
  - the **target semantics** of Pauli measurement programs.
- Align the implementation with the **verified semantics and proofs** in the accompanying paper.

## High-Level Architecture

Conceptually, the compiler is organized into the following phases:

1. **Front-end (Source Circuit Representation)**  
   - Takes as input a circuit in a Clifford-only fragment.  
   - Normalizes the circuit into an internal representation (IR) suitable for analysis and transformation.

2. **Logical Transformation / Normalization**  
   - Rewrites the Clifford circuit into a form that is easier to translate into measurement patterns  
     (e.g., via stabilizer or Pauli operator representations).
   - Ensures that all operations are compatible with the measurement-based back-end.

3. **MBQC / Pauli Measurement Back-end**  
   - Constructs a Pauli measurement program consisting of:
     - an initial state preparation pattern, and  
     - a sequence of Pauli measurements with possible classical dependencies.  
   - Ensures that the compiled program is **semantically equivalent** to the source circuit, in the sense formalized in the paper.

4. **(Planned) Verified Pipeline**  
   - The theory is developed in the paper using standard formal methods techniques.  
   - The medium-term plan is to connect this repository to a **proof assistant development** so that the implementation and the formalized semantics stay aligned.

## Status

The project is **work in progress**. At this stage, the focus is on:

- Implementing the core translation from Clifford circuits to Pauli measurement programs.
- Keeping the codebase close to the definitions and constructions in the paper, so it is easy to cross-reference.
- Designing a clean, minimal API for future back-ends (e.g., simulators or hardware-specific MBQC runtimes).

Expect breaking changes as the theory and implementation evolve together.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A recent Python version (e.g., 3.10 or later), or another language/runtime if the implementation uses a different stack.
- Standard tooling for the language used in this repository  
  (e.g., `pip`/`poetry` for Python, or `cargo` for Rust, etc.).
- A way to generate or provide **Clifford-only circuits** (for example, from an external framework such as Qiskit, or from a small custom circuit description language).
